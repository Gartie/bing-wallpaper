Bing-Wallpaper
==============

A Python Script to set the daily wallpaper of www.bing.com as a Desktop Wallpaper of Linux or Windows.

Works fine with Ubuntu 13.10 (Unity); I guess it will work with other distributions with the Gnome environments aswell.
KDE is not supported yet.
By testing it in Win7 I experienced a reset of the wallpaper after rebooting.

This isn't really finished, (especially regarding compatibility) but maybe this already is useful for someone.

If you have any questions or ideas how to improve this, tell me! ;-)
