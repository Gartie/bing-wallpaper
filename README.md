Bing-Wallpaper
==============

A Python Script to set the daily wallpaper of www.bing.com as a Desktop Wallpaper of Linux or Windows.

Works fine with Ubuntu 13.10 (Unity); I guess it will work with other distributions with the Gnome environments aswell.
KDE is not supported yet.
By testing it in Win7 I experienced a reset of the wallpaper after rebooting.


#### HowTo Use:

Just take a look at the 2-3 variables at the beginning of the script and change them to your needs. 
The Script will download the daily pictures, so a extra directory for it is recommended.


##### Note:
This isn't really finished, (especially regarding compatibility) but maybe this already is useful for someone.
If you have any questions or ideas how to improve this, tell me! ;-)
